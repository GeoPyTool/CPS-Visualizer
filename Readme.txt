Hi Fatty,
 
The raw data for your mapping run can be found at this link:
 
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64406232/DE02A13.zip
 
There are 152 data files (in .csv  format) for your sulfide sample ZK0705-P2, mapping run DE02A13.
 
Analyses 01, 02, 19, 20, 37, 38, 55, 56, 73, 74, 91, 92, 109, 110, 127, 128, 145, 146 are analyses of USGS standard GSE-1G, used for calibration of all major and trace elements except C and S.
 
Analyses 151 and 148 are analyses of a calcite standard used to calibrate C.
  
Analyses 152, 149 150, 147 are analyses of pyrrhotite standard, Po726, used to calibrate S.
 
The remaining analyses each represent a single line of data for your sample.
 
I hope this helps.
 
Best regards,
 
Simon
